# Nashville Housing Market Analytics (SQL + Power BI)

## Project Summary
This project analyzes the Nashville housing market using **PostgreSQL** for data transformation and **Power BI** for interactive dashboarding.  
The goal was to explore real-world data, clean and structure it with SQL, and visualize key market insights using BI techniques.

I completed this project to improve my Business Analytics skill set and to practice a real end-to-end workflow — similar to what analysts do in industry.

## What I Did in This Project
- Imported the raw Nashville Housing dataset into PostgreSQL
- Cleaned the data (date normalization, duplicate removal, unified flags)
- Created reporting views for easier BI consumption
- Built analytical SQL queries for segmentation & trend analysis
- Connected Power BI directly to PostgreSQL database
- Designed a dashboard that tells the story of the market performance
- Exported SQL scripts + dashboard screenshot + dataset into this repository

## Dataset
**Nashville Housing Dataset (2013–2016)**  
Includes:
- sale dates & prices  
- land use categories  
- building structure details  
- neighborhood segmentation  
- property characteristics (beds, baths, grade, area, etc.)

|-------------|-------------|
| `/sql` | SQL scripts used for cleaning, transforming & analyzing data |
| `/powerbi` | Power BI dashboard screenshot(s) |
| `/dataset` | Original raw CSV source dataset |

## Insights & What I Found
- Transactions peaked around **2015**, then slightly dropped — showing a small market cycle.
- Median sale prices **increased over time** → indicating appreciation in property values.
- **Single Family** homes dominate the market by volume.
- Vacant sales were **rare (~4–5%)**, meaning most transactions involved developed property.
- Certain **neighborhoods achieved much higher median sale prices** → premium sub-markets.
- Property characteristics (grade, bedrooms) show correlation with value.

These are insights that matter for investors, valuation analysts, and regional planning analysts.

---

## Business Recommendations  
- Focus investment attention on the neighborhoods with consistently higher median pricing.
- Track land-use changes in high-demand regions to understand future development value.
- Consider vacancy rates as a risk factor — low vacancy suggests strong housing demand.
- Further analysis could include price per square foot to compare product efficiency.
